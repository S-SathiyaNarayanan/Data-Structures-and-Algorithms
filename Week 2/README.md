## Competitive Programming Terminoloies
Test Case: Input-output examples to check if your code works for all situations (like empty inputs or huge data).
Constraints: Rules (like input size limits) that tell you how to design your code (e.g., make it fast or save memory).

Problem-Specific Terms
Constraints: Limitations on input size, memory usage, or execution time specified in the problem statement.
Test Cases: Input-output pairs used to validate the correctness of a solution. -->Sample Test Cases: Provided in the problem description for guidance.
Edge Cases: Unusual or extreme input scenarios that test the robustness of a solution.

Common Verdicts
AC: Accepted – Your solution produced the correct answer within time and memory limits.
WA: Wrong Answer – Your program produced an incorrect result for one or more test cases.
TLE: Time Limit Exceeded – Your code did not finish executing within the allowed time.
MLE: Memory Limit Exceeded – Your solution used more memory than permitted.
RE: Runtime Error – Your program crashed or encountered an error during execution.
CE: Compile Error – Your code did not compile due to syntax or other compilation issues.

## Patterns
How to approach a pattern:-
1. no of rows = no of times outer lop will run
2. Identify for given row number;
  -->how many colums are there 
  -->types of elements * in column 
3. What do you need to print ?
