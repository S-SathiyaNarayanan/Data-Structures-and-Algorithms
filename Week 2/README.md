# Week 2: Object-Oriented Programming and Competitive Programming Fundamentals

In Week 2, we delve into the foundational concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and introduce essential terminologies in Competitive Programming. Additionally, we explore pattern-based problem-solving techniques and basic mathematical operations, reinforcing our understanding through practical exercises.

## Learning Path for Week 2

### 1. Java OOP Basics

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. Key concepts include:

- **Classes and Objects**: A *class* serves as a blueprint for creating objects (instances), encapsulating data for the object and methods to manipulate that data.
- **Properties (Attributes)**: These are variables that hold the state or characteristics of an object.
- **Methods (Functions)**: Functions defined within a class that describe the behaviors or actions an object can perform.
- **Parameters vs. Arguments**: *Parameters* are variables listed in a method's definition, while *arguments* are the actual values passed to these parameters when the method is called.
- **Constructors**: Special methods invoked at the time of object creation to initialize objects.

*Refer to* `ClassAndObjects.java` *for practical implementations of these concepts.*

### 2. Competitive Programming Terminologies

Understanding the language of Competitive Programming is crucial for effective problem-solving:

- **Test Case**: Input-output pairs used to validate the correctness of a solution, including edge cases like empty inputs or large datasets.
- **Constraints**: Rules specifying input size limits, memory usage, or execution time, guiding the design of efficient code.
- **Common Verdicts**:
  - **AC (Accepted)**: Solution is correct and meets all constraints.
  - **WA (Wrong Answer)**: Solution produces incorrect results for one or more test cases.
  - **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)**: Solution fails to execute within the allowed time frame.
  - **MLE (Memory Limit Exceeded)**: Solution uses more memory than permitted.
  - **RE (Runtime Error)**: Solution crashes or encounters an error during execution.
  - **CE (Compile Error)**: Solution fails to compile due to syntax or other issues.

### 3. Pattern-Based Problem Solving

Approaching pattern problems involves:

1. **Determining the Number of Rows**: This dictates the iterations of the outer loop.
2. **Identifying Column Characteristics for Each Row**:
   - Number of columns.
   - Type of elements (e.g., `*`, numbers).
3. **Defining the Print Logic**: Establishing what needs to be printed and in what sequence.

*Pattern Problems to Practice*:
- `Pattern1.java` to `Pattern14.java`
- `ListOfPatternsToTry.md` for additional exercises.

### 4. Basic Mathematical Concepts

Enhance your problem-solving toolkit with these fundamental mathematical operations:

- **Digit Manipulation**:
  - `FindLastDigit.java`: Extract the last digit of a number.
  - `TraverseThroughLastDigit.java`: Iterate through each digit from the end.
  - `FindFirstDigit.java`: Retrieve the first digit of a number.
  - `CountDigits.java`: Determine the total number of digits in a number.
  - `FindOddAndEvenDigitsInNumber.java`: Identify and count odd and even digits.
  - `CornerDigitsSum.java`: Calculate the sum of the first and last digits.
  - `PrintTheKthDigit.java`: Access the k-th digit of a number.
