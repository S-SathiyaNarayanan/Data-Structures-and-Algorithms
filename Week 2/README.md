Test case
constraints
Test Case: Input-output examples to check if your code works for all situations (like empty inputs or huge data).
Constraints: Rules (like input size limits) that tell you how to design your code (e.g., make it fast or save memory).

(Due to technical issues, the search service is temporarily unavailable.)

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step approach to solve any DSA problem effectively:

1. Understand the Problem
Read the problem carefully (twice!).

Ask: What‚Äôs the input? Expected output? Edge cases?

Example: If asked to "find duplicates in an array," note if the array is sorted, has numbers/strings, or allows in-place modification.

2. Identify Constraints
Check input size limits (e.g., 
N
‚â§
1
0
5
N‚â§10 
5
  ‚Üí 
O
(
n
log
‚Å°
n
)
O(nlogn) or 
O
(
n
)
O(n) needed).

Note value ranges (e.g., negative numbers, overflow risks).

3. Brainstorm Approaches
Start with a brute-force solution (even if inefficient).

Optimize using patterns:

Hash Maps for lookups.

Two Pointers for sorted arrays.

Sliding Window for subarrays.

Binary Search if sorted.

Example: For "Two Sum," brute-force is 
O
(
n
2
)
O(n 
2
 ), but a hash map reduces it to 
O
(
n
)
O(n).

4. Choose the Optimal Approach
Pick the method that fits constraints (time/space).

Example: If 
N
=
1
0
6
N=10 
6
 , avoid 
O
(
n
2
)
O(n 
2
 ); use 
O
(
n
)
O(n) or 
O
(
n
log
‚Å°
n
)
O(nlogn).

5. Write Clean Code
Break into functions (if reusable).

Use clear variable names (left, right instead of i, j).

Handle edge cases first (empty input, single element).

6. Test Thoroughly
Test edge cases (empty input, min/max values).

Test normal cases (small examples from the problem).

Example: For reversing a linked list, test a 1-node list and a 5-node list.

7. Analyze Time & Space Complexity
Clearly state your solution‚Äôs Big O (e.g., 
O
(
n
)
O(n) time, 
O
(
1
)
O(1) space).

Example Workflow:
Problem: Find the first unique character in a string.

Understand: Input = "leetcode" ‚Üí Output = 0 (index of 'l').

Constraints: String length ‚â§ 
1
0
5
10 
5
  ‚Üí Need 
O
(
n
)
O(n) time.

Approach: Use a hash map to count character frequencies.

Code: Loop through the string, store counts, then loop again to find the first count=1.

Test:

Edge case: "aabb" ‚Üí return -1.

Normal case: "loveleetcode" ‚Üí return 2.

Pro Tips:
Practice pattern recognition (e.g., sliding window, BFS/DFS).

If stuck, think: "What‚Äôs the bottleneck? How can I reduce it?"

Don‚Äôt code immediately‚Äîthink first!

By following this structured approach, you‚Äôll solve problems faster and more efficiently! üöÄ
