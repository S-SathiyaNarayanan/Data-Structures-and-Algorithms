ðŸª™GeeksforGeeks - LCM And GCD
Given two integers a and b, the task is to compute their LCM and GCD and return an array containing their LCM 
and GCD
Input: a = 5 , b = 10
Output: [10, 5]
Explanation: LCM of 5 and 10 is 10, while their GCD is 5
Input: a = 14 , b = 8
Output: [56, 2]
Explanation: LCM of 14 and 8 is 56, while their GCD is 2
