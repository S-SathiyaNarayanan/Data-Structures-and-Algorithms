# Week 1: Java Fundamentals

In Week 1 of the Data Structures and Algorithms course, you’ll dive into the core basics of Java programming. You'll learn about variables, data types, and operators. The focus will be on control structures like loops and conditionals. Simple problem-solving techniques will be introduced to strengthen your understanding. This week lays the groundwork for future concepts.


## Learning Path for Beginners

### 1. Introduction to Java

- **[HelloWorld.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/HelloWorld.java)**  
  Learn how to print a simple message to the console.
- **[PrimitiveDataTypes.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/PrimitiveDataTypes.java)**  
  Understand Java's fundamental data types.
- **[BasicInputOutput.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/BasicInputOutput.java)**  
  Learn the basics of reading input from and writing output to the console.

### 2. Basic Operations
- **[ArithmeticOperations.Java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ArithmeticOperations.Java)**  
  Explore arithmetic operations and see how Java handles mathematical computations.

### 3. Control Structures
- **[IfStatements.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/IfStatements.java)**  
  Implement conditional logic with if-else statements.
- **[SwitchStatement.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/SwitchStatement.java)**  
  Learn how switch-case simplifies multiple conditional checks.

---

### 4. Loops
- **[ForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ForLoop.java)**  
  Work with for loops to iterate efficiently.
- **[NestedForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/NestedForLoop.java)**  
  Understand how nested loops handle multi-dimensional data.
- **[WhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/WhileLoop.java)**  
  Use while loops for repeated tasks based on conditions.
- **[DoWhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/DoWhileLoop.java)**  
  Understand do-while loops, which always execute at least once.
