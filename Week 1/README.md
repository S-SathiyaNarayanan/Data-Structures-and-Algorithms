# Week 1: Java Fundamentals

This folder contains the Week 1 projects for the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The focus of this week is on the basics of Java programming, including introductory concepts, control structures, loops, and simple problem-solving.

## Overview

In Week 1, you will find examples and exercises covering:
- **Hello World**: A simple program to print "Hello, World!".
- **Primitive Data Types**: Demonstrations of Java's fundamental data types.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Examples showcasing basic mathematical operations.

Additional programs in this folder illustrate:
- Basic input and output operations.
- Different types of loops (for, while, do-while, and nested loops).
- Conditional statements like if-else and switch-case.
- Practice problems to reinforce the concepts.

## Folder Structure

- **Main Concepts:**
  - `HelloWorld.java` – Prints "Hello, World!" to the console.
  - `PrimitiveDataTypes.java` – Demonstrates usage of primitive data types.
  - `ArithmeticOperations.java` – Contains examples of arithmetic operations.

- **Control Structures and Loops:**
  - `BasicInputOutput.java` – Introduces basic input and output.
  - `DoWhileLoop.java` – Example of a do-while loop.
  - `ForLoop.java` – Example of a for loop.
  - `IfStatements.java` – Shows usage of if-else statements.
  - `NestedForLoop.java` – Demonstrates nested loops.
  - `SwitchStatement.java` – Example of a switch-case statement.
  - `WhileLoop.java` – Example of a while loop.

- **Practice Problems:**
  - `Problem1.java` to `Problem7.java` – Each file contains exercises or problems designed to reinforce the week's lessons.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java installed. The code is compatible with JDK 8 and above.
- **Development Environment**: Use any IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).

### How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile a Java File:**
   Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to this folder, and run:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
