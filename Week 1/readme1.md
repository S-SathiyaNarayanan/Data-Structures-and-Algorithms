# Week 1: Java Fundamentals

This folder contains Week 1 of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The focus is on the basics of Java programming, including introductory concepts, control structures, loops, and simple problem-solving. 

## Learning Path for Beginners

### 1. Introduction to Java
- **[HelloWorld.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/HelloWorld.java)**  
  Learn how to print a simple message to the console.
- **[PrimitiveDataTypes.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/PrimitiveDataTypes.java)**  
  Understand Java's fundamental data types.
- **[BasicInputOutput.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/BasicInputOutput.java)**  
  Learn the basics of reading input from and writing output to the console.

### 2. Basic Operations
- **[ArithmeticOperations.Java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ArithmeticOperations.Java)**  
  Explore arithmetic operations and see how Java handles mathematical computations.

### 3. Control Structures
- **[IfStatements.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/IfStatements.java)**  
  Learn to use conditional logic with if-else statements.
- **[SwitchStatement.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/SwitchStatement.java)**  
  Understand how switch-case can simplify multiple conditional checks.

### 4. Loops
- **[ForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ForLoop.java)**  
  Begin with the for loop to iterate a set number of times.
- **[NestedForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/NestedForLoop.java)**  
  See how loops can be nested to work with multi-dimensional data or complex logic.
- **[WhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/WhileLoop.java)**  
  Learn the while loop for repeating tasks based on a condition.
- **[DoWhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/DoWhileLoop.java)**  
  Discover the do-while loop, which guarantees at least one execution.
- **[NestedForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/NestedForLoop.java)**  
  See how loops can be nested to work with multi-dimensional data or complex logic.

### 5. Practice Problems
Work on these exercises to reinforce the concepts:
- **[Problem1.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem1.java)**
- **[Problem2.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem2.java)**
- **[Problem3.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem3.java)**
- **[Problem4.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem4.java)**
- **[Problem5.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem5.java)**
- **[Problem6.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem6.java)**
- **[Problem7.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem7.java)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or above is recommended).
- **Development Environment**: Use any IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).

### How to Compile and Run

1. **Compile a Java File:**
