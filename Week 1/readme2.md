# Week 1: Java Fundamentals

This folder contains Week 1 of the Data Structures and Algorithms course. The focus is on the basics of Java programming, including introductory concepts, control structures, loops, and simple problem-solving.

## Learning Path for Beginners

### 1. Introduction to Java
- **[HelloWorld.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/HelloWorld.java)**  
  Learn how to print a simple message to the console.
- **[PrimitiveDataTypes.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/PrimitiveDataTypes.java)**  
  Understand Java's fundamental data types.
- **[BasicInputOutput.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/BasicInputOutput.java)**  
  Learn the basics of reading input from and writing output to the console.

### 2. Basic Operations
- **[ArithmeticOperations.Java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ArithmeticOperations.Java)**  
  Explore arithmetic operations and see how Java handles mathematical computations.

### 3. Control Structures
- **[IfStatements.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/IfStatements.java)**  
  Learn to use conditional logic with if-else statements.
- **[SwitchStatement.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/SwitchStatement.java)**  
  Understand how switch-case can simplify multiple conditional checks.

### 4. Loops
- **[ForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/ForLoop.java)**  
  Begin with the for loop to iterate a set number of times.
- **[NestedForLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/NestedForLoop.java)**  
  See how loops can be nested to work with multi-dimensional data or complex logic.
- **[WhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/WhileLoop.java)**  
  Learn the while loop for repeating tasks based on a condition.
- **[DoWhileLoop.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/DoWhileLoop.java)**  
  Discover the do-while loop, which guarantees at least one execution.

## Practice Problems

Below are several practice problems with direct file links and their corresponding questions.

### Problem 1
- **File:** [Problem1.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem1.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program that takes an integer, then a string, then a character from the user and prints them on the screen.

### Problem 2
- **File:** [Problem2.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem2.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program to check whether a triangle can be formed with the given values for the angles. A triangle can be formed if the sum of the angles is 180; otherwise, it cannot be formed.

### Problem 3
- **File:** [Problem3.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem3.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Given the mark of a student, print the grade based on these criteria:
  - Grade A if the mark is greater than or equal to 90
  - Grade B if the mark is greater than or equal to 80
  - Grade C if the mark is greater than or equal to 60
  - Grade D if the mark is greater than or equal to 35
  - Otherwise, print Fail

### Problem 4
- **File:** [Problem4.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem4.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program using switch-case that takes a value (size) and prints its corresponding size description. If the size is not one of the specified values, print "Invalid".

### Problem 5
- **File:** [Problem5.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem5.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program that takes two values, `x` and `y`, and prints the value of `x` a total of `y` times.

### Problem 6
- **File:** [Problem6.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem6.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program to take an integer `x` and print its multiples until 1000.

### Problem 7
- **File:** [Problem7.java](https://github.com/S-SathiyaNarayanan/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/blob/main/Week%201/Problem7.java)  
- **Question:**  
  Write a program that takes a first name, a last name, and an integer `n` as input, then prints the concatenated full name (first name + last name) a total of `n` times.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Ensure you have Java installed (JDK 8 or above is recommended).
- **Development Environment:** Use any IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code).
